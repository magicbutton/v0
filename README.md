Each project directory under `prompts/v0/` now contains:

- **`readme.md`**: the primary prompt definition and usage instructions.
- **`attachments.zip`**: any supplementary files (e.g., data samples, images, code snippets) bundled for easy download.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Browse existing prompts** in `prompts/v0/project-*/readme.md` to find inspiration for your project.
2. **Copy `prompts/v0/template.md`** into a new directory named after your project (e.g. `prompts/v0/my-new-project/`).
3. **Create** within that directory:
   - `readme.md` with your customized prompt content.
   - `attachments.zip` bundling any required assets.
4. **Test** your prompt interactively with your preferred LLM or playground.

## üìù Prompt Directory Guidelines

Each project folder (e.g. `prompts/v0/project-a/`) should include:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Context
- A brief description of the problem or scenario

## Instructions
1. Step-by-step guidance the model should follow
2. Key deliverables and formatting requirements

## Examples (Optional)
- **Input example:** ...
- **Expected output:** ...

## Variables
- `{{query}}`: Description of variable to interpolate
- `{{user_name}}`: Description of variable to interpolate
```

Place additional resources‚Äîdatasets, images, code snippets, etc.‚Äîinside `attachments.zip`. Users can download this archive to access all supporting files in one go.

Use `template.md` as a reference when creating new v0 prompt directories.
